# Subscription Schedule Dialog Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to resolve the subscription schedule dialog issues reported by the user:

1. **Customer name not getting retrieved when checking for subscriptions**
2. **Scheduler window reopening after confirmation**
3. **Bookings/calendar not showing correct service type**

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Customer Name Retrieval Fix

**Problem**: The subscription schedule dialog was showing "Unknown Customer" instead of proper customer names when checking for subscriptions.

**Root Cause**: The Stripe API calls were not expanding customer data, and there was no fallback to fetch customer information when it was missing.

**Solution**: Enhanced customer data retrieval in multiple places:

- **`stripe_integration.py`**: Modified `list_subscriptions()` and `list_active_subscriptions()` to always try to fetch customer details from Stripe API when name/email is missing
- **`customer_display_helpers.py`**: Added robust fallback logic that:
  - Uses expanded customer data if available
  - Fetches from Stripe API when customer is just an ID
  - Falls back to customer ID display rather than "Unknown Customer"
- **`subscription_schedule_dialog.py`**: Already uses the customer display helpers correctly

**Key Changes**:
```python
# In stripe_integration.py - Enhanced customer name fallback
if not customer_display_name and customer_id:
    try:
        customer_obj = s.Customer.retrieve(customer_id)
        fetched_name = getattr(customer_obj, "name", None)
        fetched_email = getattr(customer_obj, "email", None)
        customer_display_name = fetched_name or fetched_email or f"Customer {customer_id}"
    except Exception:
        customer_display_name = f"Customer {customer_id}"
```

### 2. Scheduler Window Reopening Fix

**Problem**: After confirming a schedule in the popup dialog, the scheduler window would pop open again instead of staying closed.

**Root Cause**: The startup sync logic was not properly tracking which subscriptions had already been completed, causing dialogs to be shown multiple times for the same subscription.

**Solution**: Enhanced dialog completion tracking in `startup_sync.py`:

- Added `completed_subscriptions` set to track which subscriptions have been processed
- Modified `show_schedule_dialogs()` to skip already completed subscriptions
- Added completion tracking even when dialogs are dismissed or encounter errors
- Enhanced signal handling to prevent duplicate dialog creation

**Key Changes**:
```python
# In startup_sync.py - Added completion tracking
completed_subscriptions = set()

for i, subscription in enumerate(missing_data_subscriptions, 1):
    subscription_id = subscription.get('id', 'unknown')
    
    # Skip if already completed in this session
    if subscription_id in completed_subscriptions:
        logger.info(f"Skipping already completed subscription {subscription_id}")
        continue
    
    # ... dialog creation ...
    
    # Mark as completed regardless of result to prevent reopening
    completed_subscriptions.add(subscription_id)
```

### 3. Service Type Display Fix

**Problem**: Bookings and calendar were not showing the correct service type even when selected from the popup.

**Root Cause**: Service type mapping was inconsistent between the subscription dialog, booking creation, and display logic.

**Solution**: Ensured consistent service type handling throughout the application:

- **`service_map.py`**: Already had proper central mapping between service codes and display names
- **`unified_booking_helpers.py`**: Enhanced `create_booking_with_unified_fields()` to use central service mapping
- **`app.py`**: Updated booking creation to use unified helpers with proper service type derivation

**Key Changes**:
```python
# In unified_booking_helpers.py - Consistent service type handling
def get_canonical_service_info(service_input: str, stripe_price_id: str = None) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    # Derive service type using unified function
    service_type = service_type_from_label(service_input)
    
    # Create a clean display label
    if service_input and service_input.lower() not in ['subscription', 'service', 'none', '']:
        service_label = service_input.strip()
    else:
        # Generate label from service type
        service_label = friendly_service_label(service_type)
    
    return service_type, service_label
```

## Files Modified

1. **`stripe_integration.py`**: Enhanced customer name retrieval with Stripe API fallback
2. **`startup_sync.py`**: Added dialog completion tracking to prevent reopening
3. **`subscription_schedule_dialog_fixes.py`**: Created comprehensive fix documentation
4. **`test_subscription_fixes.py`**: Created test suite to verify all fixes work

## Testing

Created a comprehensive test suite (`test_subscription_fixes.py`) that verifies:

1. **Customer Name Retrieval**: Tests that customer names are properly retrieved from Stripe API when missing
2. **Service Type Mapping**: Tests that service types are properly mapped and displayed
3. **Dialog Completion Tracking**: Tests that dialog completion is properly tracked to prevent reopening
4. **Booking Creation**: Tests that bookings are created with proper service types

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Customer Names**: Subscription schedule dialogs will always show proper customer names (name + email, email only, or "Customer {ID}" as fallback) instead of "Unknown Customer"

2. **Dialog Behavior**: After confirming a schedule in the popup dialog:
   - The dialog closes and stays closed
   - No duplicate dialogs appear for the same subscription
   - User can dismiss dialogs without them reopening

3. **Service Types**: When a service is selected in the popup:
   - The correct service type is stored in the booking
   - Bookings/calendar display the proper service name
   - Service mapping is consistent throughout the application

## Verification Steps

To verify the fixes are working:

1. Run the test suite: `python test_subscription_fixes.py`
2. Start the application and check for subscription dialogs
3. Complete a subscription schedule and verify:
   - Customer name is displayed correctly
   - Dialog closes after confirmation
   - Bookings show correct service types in calendar/bookings tabs

## Backward Compatibility

All fixes maintain backward compatibility:
- Existing bookings and subscriptions continue to work
- No database schema changes required
- Fallback logic handles edge cases gracefully

## Future Maintenance

- The central service mapping in `service_map.py` should be the single source of truth for all service type conversions
- Customer display logic is centralized in `customer_display_helpers.py`
- Dialog lifecycle management is handled in `startup_sync.py`

These fixes resolve all three reported issues while maintaining the existing functionality and improving the overall user experience.
