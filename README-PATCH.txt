HOW TO USE
1) Close the app. Extract this zip at the project root (same folder as app.py).
2) Run Run-Patch.bat (double-click). A backup app.py.bak is created.
3) Open the app → Bookings → press Refresh to see this week+next week from DB + subs + invoices.
Invoice metadata required: booking_start, booking_end (ISO), service; optional dogs, location.
