"""
One-time cleanup script for duplicate bookings.

This script removes duplicate bookings that may have been created before
the unique constraint was implemented. It follows the strategy:

1. Remove non-invoiced duplicates when an invoiced copy exists for same slot
2. Collapse any remaining exact duplicates (keep one with lowest ID)

Run this once after implementing the unique constraint to clean up existing data.
