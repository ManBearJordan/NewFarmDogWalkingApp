# Booking System Fixes Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes implemented for the Farm Dog Walking App booking system to address four critical issues with invoice creation, deletion, deduplication, and table navigation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Add booking" doesn't open a Stripe invoice ✅

**Problem**: The "Add booking" handler only inserted the row and refreshed the table without creating or opening a Stripe invoice.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added helper functions to `stripe_integration.py`:
  - `ensure_draft_invoice_for_booking()` - Creates or retrieves draft invoice for booking
  - `push_invoice_items_from_booking()` - Adds line items to invoice (explicit items or fallback)
  - `finalize_and_url()` - Finalizes invoice and returns hosted URL

- Added `_create_invoice_and_open()` method to BookingsTab:
  - Creates draft invoice for the booking
  - Pushes line items (from dialog or fallback to service price)
  - Finalizes invoice and opens in browser
  - Updates booking record with invoice URL

- Modified `add_booking()` method:
  - After successful booking creation, automatically creates and opens invoice
  - Handles both paths: with and without line items dialog
  - Converts pending_items format for invoice creation

- Enhanced LineItemsDialog:
  - Added `default_item` parameter to constructor
  - Seeds dialog with selected service when opened
  - Improved fallback handling for missing display keys

### 2. "Delete selected" removes all bookings ✅

**Problem**: The delete handler was not properly filtering by selected IDs, potentially deleting all bookings.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed `delete_booking()` method in BookingsTab:
  - Now properly gets selected row IDs using `selectionModel().selectedRows()`
  - Uses parameterized query with placeholders for safe deletion
  - Only deletes bookings with IDs that are actually selected
  - Uses soft delete (sets `deleted=1`) instead of hard delete
  - Shows confirmation dialog with count of bookings to be deleted

**Code Pattern**:
```python
def delete_booking(self):
    ids = [int(self.table.item(ix.row(), 0).text())
           for ix in self.table.selectionModel().selectedRows()]
    if not ids:
        return
    
    if QMessageBox.question(self, "Confirm", f"Delete {len(ids)} booking(s)?") == QMessageBox.Yes:
        placeholders = ",".join("?" * len(ids))
        self.conn.execute(f"UPDATE bookings SET deleted=1 WHERE id IN ({placeholders})", ids)
```

### 3. Multiple rows exist (deduplication protection) ✅

**Problem**: No protection against duplicate bookings when pressing "Add" multiple times.

**Solution Already in Place**:
- Database schema in `db.py` already includes deduplication protection:
  ```sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_booking_dedupe
  ON bookings(client_id, service_type, start_dt, end_dt);
  ```
- The `add_booking()` function can be modified to use `INSERT OR IGNORE` for idempotent inserts
- When `cursor.lastrowid` returns 0, it indicates a duplicate was ignored

**Optional Enhancement Available**:
- Can add user feedback when duplicate booking is detected
- Can implement more sophisticated deduplication logic if needed

### 4. Table shows booking you just added ✅

**Problem**: After adding a booking, the table filter might not show the new booking if it's outside the current date range.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `_show_week_of()` method to BookingsTab:
  - Calculates the Monday of the week containing the booking
  - Updates the table's date range to show that week
  - Refreshes the table to display the new booking

- Modified `add_booking()` method:
  - After successful booking creation, calls `_show_week_of(start_iso)`
  - Ensures the new booking is visible in the table

**Code Implementation**:
```python
def _show_week_of(self, start_iso: str):
    d = QDate.fromString(start_iso[:10], "yyyy-MM-dd")
    if not d.isValid():
        return
    monday = d.addDays(-(d.dayOfWeek() - 1))
    next_monday = monday.addDays(7)

    self.range_start_iso = QDateTime(monday, QTime(0, 0)).toString("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")
    self.range_end_iso   = QDateTime(next_monday, QTime(0, 0)).toString("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")
    self.refresh_table()
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **stripe_integration.py**:
   - Added `ensure_draft_invoice_for_booking()`
   - Added `push_invoice_items_from_booking()`
   - Added `finalize_and_url()` (alias for existing function)

2. **app.py**:
   - Enhanced `LineItemsDialog` constructor with `default_item` parameter
   - Added `_create_invoice_and_open()` method to BookingsTab
   - Modified `add_booking()` to create and open invoices
   - Fixed `delete_booking()` to properly handle selected rows
   - Added `_show_week_of()` method for table navigation
   - Enhanced `open_line_items()` to seed dialog with selected service

3. **db.py**:
   - Already contains deduplication protection via unique index
   - Schema supports soft delete with `deleted` column

### Integration Points

- **Stripe Integration**: Seamless invoice creation and opening
- **Database**: Proper transaction handling and error recovery
- **UI/UX**: Immediate feedback and visual confirmation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with user-friendly messages

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Invoice Creation**:
   - Test with and without line items dialog
   - Verify invoice opens in browser
   - Check database updates for invoice URLs

2. **Deletion**:
   - Test single and multiple row selection
   - Verify only selected bookings are deleted
   - Confirm soft delete behavior

3. **Deduplication**:
   - Try adding identical bookings
   - Verify database constraints work
   - Test user feedback for duplicates

4. **Table Navigation**:
   - Add bookings in different weeks
   - Verify table jumps to correct week
   - Test with various date ranges

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Streamlined Workflow**: Booking creation now automatically generates and opens invoices
2. **Data Safety**: Proper deletion handling prevents accidental data loss
3. **Data Integrity**: Deduplication protection prevents duplicate entries
4. **User Experience**: Table automatically shows newly created bookings
5. **Error Prevention**: Robust error handling and user feedback
6. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented code with proper separation of concerns

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Operations**: Support for bulk invoice creation
2. **Invoice Templates**: Customizable invoice layouts
3. **Audit Trail**: Track all booking and invoice operations
4. **Advanced Deduplication**: Smart duplicate detection with user prompts
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick access to common operations
