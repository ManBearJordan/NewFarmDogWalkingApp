# Unified Booking Helper Functions - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the "minimal dev changes" from `DEBUGGING_REPORT.md` to fix service type derivation, customer resolution, and subscription booking issues in the dog walking app.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. âœ… One Resolver for Stripe â†’ Client

**Problem**: Multiple inconsistent approaches to resolving customer IDs from Stripe data to local client records.

**Solution**: Created unified `resolve_client_id()` function in `unified_booking_helpers.py`

- **Standardizes on `clients.stripe_customer_id`** (deprecating `stripeCustomerId` everywhere)
- **Single function** used by both invoice importer and subscription save/rebuild paths
- **Automatic migration** from legacy `stripeCustomerId` column to preferred `stripe_customer_id`
- **Proper validation** of Stripe customer ID format

**Files Updated**:
- `unified_booking_helpers.py` - New unified function
- `stripe_invoice_bookings.py` - Updated to use unified resolver
- `app.py` - Subscription booking generation uses unified resolver

### 2. âœ… One Service-Type Derivation Path

**Problem**: Multiple similar functions across different files with incomplete logic for handling complex service names.

**Solution**: Created robust `service_type_from_label()` function in `unified_booking_helpers.py`

- **Normalizes Unicode** (â€“ â†’ -, Ã— â†’ x) 
- **Strips parentheses/extra punctuation**
- **Maps to canonical codes** (e.g., `DAYCARE_SINGLE`, `WALK_SHORT_SINGLE`, `OVERNIGHT_SINGLE`)
- **Handles edge cases** like "Subscription" placeholder labels
- **Used everywhere** bookings are created: importer + subscription writer + manual booking UI

**Test Results**:
```
âœ“ 'Home Visit â€“ 30m (1Ã—/day)' â†’ 'HOME_VISIT_30M_SINGLE'
âœ“ 'Poop Scoop â€“ One-time' â†’ 'SCOOP_SINGLE'
âœ“ 'Short Walk' â†’ 'WALK_SHORT_SINGLE'
âœ“ 'Subscription' â†’ 'WALK_GENERAL' (fixed placeholder)
```

### 3. âœ… Write (and Read) the Same Fields

**Problem**: Multiple overlapping fields for service information with inconsistent population.

**Solution**: Created `create_booking_with_unified_fields()` function

**Always sets**:
- `service_type` (canonical code)
- `service` (pretty label derived from the code)
- `service_name` (alias, same as service)
- `stripe_price_id` (when present)
- `source` (manual/subscription/invoice)
- `created_from_sub_id` (when from subscription)

**Files Updated**:
- `unified_booking_helpers.py` - New unified booking creation function
- `app.py` - Manual booking creation uses unified function
- `stripe_invoice_bookings.py` - Uses unified service info extraction

### 4. âœ… Subscriptions Save â†’ Purge-Then-Rebuild

**Problem**: Stale "rogue" subscription bookings not being cleaned up when schedules change.

**Solution**: Implemented automatic purge-then-rebuild pattern

- **`purge_future_subscription_bookings()`** - Deletes future bookings where `source='subscription'` AND `created_from_sub_id=<sub>` AND `start_dt>=today`
- **`rebuild_subscription_bookings()`** - Generates next 3 months with unified fields
- **Automatic UI refresh** - Calendar and Bookings tabs refresh immediately
- **No manual steps required** - Happens automatically on subscription save

**Files Updated**:
- `unified_booking_helpers.py` - New purge and rebuild functions
- `app.py` - Subscription save uses purge-then-rebuild pattern

### 5. âœ… Optional Price Code Tracking

**Enhancement**: Added support for persisting `price_code` on bookings when available from Stripe metadata.

- `create_booking_with_unified_fields()` accepts `stripe_price_id` parameter
- Stored in booking records for better reporting
- Links bookings to price configurations

## Test Results

All unified functions have been thoroughly tested:

```
============================================================
TEST RESULTS SUMMARY
============================================================
Service Type Derivation: PASS
Client Resolution: PASS
Canonical Service Info: PASS
Unified Booking Creation: PASS
Purge Functionality: PASS

Overall: 5 passed, 0 failed

ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! The unified booking helpers are working correctly.
```

## Benefits Achieved

### âœ… No More "Subscription Customer"
- Bookings always carry the real client through unified resolver
- Consistent customer resolution across all booking creation paths

### âœ… Consistent Service Labels
- Same service_type and display service applied consistently
- Calendar and Bookings show the same correct labels
- No more mismatched labels across views

### âœ… Fewer Field Inconsistencies
- Standardized field population reduces chances for mismatched data
- All booking creation paths write the same fields consistently

### âœ… Automatic Schedule Updates
- Saved subscription schedules immediately show up correctly
- No stale "rogue" rows from old schedules
- UI refreshes automatically without manual rebuilds

### âœ… Better Maintainability
- Single source of truth for service type derivation
- Single source of truth for customer resolution
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier to debug and maintain

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `unified_booking_helpers.py` - Core unified functions
- `test_unified_fixes.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `UNIFIED_FIXES_IMPLEMENTED.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `stripe_invoice_bookings.py` - Uses unified resolver and service derivation
- `app.py` - Subscription and manual booking creation use unified functions

## Quick Verification Commands

You can verify the fixes are working by running:

```bash
# Run the test suite
python test_unified_fixes.py

# Check for placeholder bookings (should return no results)
sqlite3 app.db "SELECT id, client_id, service, service_type, source, created_from_sub_id FROM bookings WHERE start_dt >= date('now') AND (client_id IS NULL OR client_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM clients) OR service='Subscription' OR service_type LIKE 'SUBSCRIPTION%');"
```

## Conclusion

The minimal dev changes have been successfully implemented and tested. The app now has:

1. **One resolver** for Stripe â†’ client (standardized on `stripe_customer_id`)
2. **One service-type derivation path** (robust Unicode handling and canonical mapping)
3. **Consistent field population** (always writes same service/service_type pair)
4. **Automatic purge-then-rebuild** for subscription bookings
5. **Optional price code tracking** for better reporting

These changes ensure that Calendar and Bookings will show the same, correct client and service information every time, eliminating the inconsistencies identified in the debugging report.
